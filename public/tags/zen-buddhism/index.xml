      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Koan: The Muddy Road&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tanzan and Ekido were once traveling together down a muddy road. A heavy rain was still falling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coming around a bend, they met a lovely girl in a silk kimono and sash, unable to cross the intersection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Come on, girl” said Tanzan at once. Lifting her in his arms, he carried her over the mud.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ekido did not speak again until that night when they reached a lodging temple. Then he no longer could restrain himself. “We monks don’t go near females,” he told Tanzan, “especially not young and lovely ones. It is dangerous. Why did you do that?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
