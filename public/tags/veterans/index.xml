      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/image.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This weekend, as we are having our picnics and barbecues and celebrating the start of summer, take some time to remember those who have paid the ultimate price for our nation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also remember the 80,000 service members who were missing in action, and hope we can find their remains and bring them back home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An area of practice Iâ€™ve been in for about a year now is providing massage and bodywork services to our military veterans. As a veteran myself (USN 1988 to 1993), I understand many of the unique stressors and conditions that our military veterans have experienced during their time of service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of our servicemembers and veterans carry injuries and emotional trauma unique to their situations. My work has evolved a deeply sensitive approach to their bodies and needs, and this area of practice is some of the most rewarding I do. Helping our military members and veterans feel less pain and stress from their time of service is profoundly humbling and gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
