I was briefly knocked unconscious and blah, blah, blah, sustained some injuries and damage to my electronics. Whatever right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, not really. Although I survived, and I will get the necessary care I need to heal as much as I can, the experience compelled to do some frank and cogent examination of the state of affairs of my bodywork practice, and more importantly, my attitude toward &amp;ldquo;tending the garden,&amp;rdquo; as it were.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
