      <description>&lt;p&gt;An area of practice Iâ€™ve been in for about a year now is providing massage and bodywork services to our military veterans. As a veteran myself (USN 1988 to 1993), I understand many of the unique stressors and conditions that our military veterans have experienced during their time of service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of our servicemembers and veterans carry injuries and emotional trauma unique to their situations. My work has evolved a deeply sensitive approach to their bodies and needs, and this area of practice is some of the most rewarding I do. Helping our military members and veterans feel less pain and stress from their time of service is profoundly humbling and gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
