      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;saying-yes&#34;&gt;Saying Yes&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my New Year’s resolutions this year was to say yes to more things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last week at about 330 on Friday morning, I got up to let my dog out to P, and I was standing in the backyard and I saw a shooting star. I immediately spread my arms wide and turned my face up to the sky and “open“ my emotional self to receive whatever my subconscious was about to tell me. About 30 seconds later, I thought a second shooting star, and the idea came into my head that I need to be putting more energy into my Bodywork practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
