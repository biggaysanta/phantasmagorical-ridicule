      <title>My Depression and Anxiety Strategy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been diagnosed with major depression disorder since 2015. Before I sought care, I used to allow myself to perform my mindless, default behaviors, especially avoidant behaviors - things like staying in bed for days at a time, canceling social plans last minute. I lost many of my social connections: people gave up on me, stopped asking me to participating in things. Avoidance is a killing blow to one’s friendships, to work life, to one’s value system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So back on 17 January 2024, I was walking along a sidewalk and I was struck by an F-150 pickup truck. I was briefly knocked unconscious and blah, blah, blah, sustained some injuries and damage to my electronics. Whatever right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, not really. Although I survived, and I will get the necessary care I need to heal as much as I can, the experience compelled to do some frank and cogent examination of the state of affairs of my bodywork practice, and more importantly, my attitude toward &amp;ldquo;tending the garden,&amp;rdquo; as it were.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hungry? Take the Apple Test</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-apple-test-whats-that&#34;&gt;The Apple Test? What’s That?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve struggled with emotional, or comfort, eating for a long time, as long as I can remember. The coping mechanism might have been useful at some point in the past, but it helped me balloon up to 470 pounds, and eventually seek &lt;a href=&#34;https://paulbrown.net/tag/bariatric-chronicles/&#34;&gt;out bariatric surgery&lt;/a&gt; back in 2017, and lose 200 pounds. To help develop a healthier habit, I do what I call the Apple Test.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
