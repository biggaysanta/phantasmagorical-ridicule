## Ah, then you must be looking for The OG and Still the Best Couples Massage Workshop

In this two-hour, private class, you and a loved one will learn:

- The Whole Body Does the Massage
- Through the Process of Weight Transfer
- While Maintaining a Good Line of Force
- Having the Hands Move Last
- and Backing Up to Get Low

With these five principles, you will learn how to stand, move, hand positions, control speed and pressure, safe (and not safe) landmarks on your bodies, and a lot more!  It's great fun, and you'll laugh a lot while learning a fun skill you can take home!

I only book my Couples Massage Workshop over the phone or text: 916-534-8772

## Well, then, perhaps you're looking for my Award Winning Massage Blog?

Sadly, at this time, the blog is undergoing repairs, kinda like Highway 50 (LOL), ok, maybe not that, but stay tuned, it'll be back better than ever!
