## Google Map

I've embedded this Google Map to show the location of street and garage parking within close proximity to my office.  The yellow highlighted icons and graphics show the best parking for a quick walk to my office.  My office is the green heart icon.

Downtown is a lively place to [come get a massage](https://paulbrown.noterro.com/), or a mani-pedi, or enjoy a great meal, check out the theatre, show, enjoy nightlife!

## Local Recommendations

Here are some local attractions for after you get your massage, or when you are spending time downtown in general!

- [Kodaiko Ramen and Bar](https://kodaikoramen.com/)
I have to say, I really like this place - their broths and noodles are so amazing, subtle and delicious.  And the downstairs vibe has a real step back into history feel to it.  You're stepping back in time as you descend to the subterranean restaurant. Highly recommended.

- [Koja Kitchen](https://kojakitchensactown.com)
This Korean-Japanese fusion joint has tasty food, and the windows make for great people watching!

- [Con Azúcar Café Sacramento](http://conazucarcafe.com)
I mean, how can you go wrong with a name like **With Sugar**? The coffee is really good, and again, the huge expanse of glass makes for great light, and fun people watching!  Check it out...

- [Sauced BBQ & Spirits](www.saucedbbqandspirits.com)
I just have two words: axe throwing.  OK, maybe two more: good barbecue.

How can you go wrong with a rooftop bar that offers nice views of downtown and DOCO?

- [https://goldenonecenter.com](Golden One Center)
  Safe to say, the most popular event venue around - home of the Sacramento Kings, this modern, state-of-the-art arena is perfect for concerts, ice skating, monster trucks, and graduations!  Plus, the box office is right across 7th Street if you want to get a ticket at the last minute.
- Estelle's Patisserie
  My secret love.
- Macaron
- Champagne
- Hagen Daas

And so many more... Downtown is way more cool than the 'burbies think!
