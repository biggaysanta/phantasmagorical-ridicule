## What is my referral program?

Everybody knows someone that can benefit from skilled massage therapy - yourself, your spouse, parent, relative, coworker, boss, neighbor, postal carrier - everybody carries stress in their body, has some kind of pain, or other condition that can benefit from therapeutic touch like massage therapy.

## How does it work?

That's why I offer a "refer three, get one free" referral program - send me three clients, and you'll get a free hour gift card to use for yourself or give away!Â  Word of mouth is the best advertising, and I truly believe in the power of touch to bring about positive change in our mind-body connection - you can feel great, and massage can help!

## Word of mouth advertising is the best

Tell your friends about Paul Brown Massage Therapy - it's a win-win all around!

## Remember self-care, too
