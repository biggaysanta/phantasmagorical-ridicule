## Make a Commitment to Yourself and Save

 I offer a ***monthly membership discount program*** I call the ***Secret Handshake Club***: it’s a recurring membership that provides three main benefits:

- One benefit massage per billing period. You use it before the next billing period starts.  You're not buying a massage, you are subscribing to a discount massage program; the massage doesn't roll over - think gym membership, not old-school cell phone plan.
- Discounted Massages: beyond the benefit massage, the membership offers a 20% discount on all other massage services (except the couples massage workshop and gift cards.)

## Benefits of regular massage

- Ongoing lessening Pain and Stress
- Improved mood
- Greater Range of Motion
- Boosted immune function
- And that **GREAT FEELING** that comes from knowing you’re taking ongoing steps to manage and improve your overall pain level and health!

I do offer the Secret Handshake Club at two price points:  

- Gold, includes one benefit 90 minute massage session per billing period, plus the discount for additional session, for $155/month.

- Silver, which includes one benefit 60 minute massage treatment per billing period, and further treatments discounted 20% for $120/month

As you can see, it’s a great deal for ongoing self care.

There are a few caveats:

- The benefit massage must be used during its billing period; it does not rollover.
- It’s only for services, not gift cards, nor the [Couples Massage Workshop](/couples-massage-workshop/).
- Non-transferable
- I require a 6 month commitment, then it goes month to month and can be cancelled at any point before the next billing cycle..

You can call or text me at 916-534-8772 to get started - we can start the transaction over the phone, then you eSign the agreement on your phone, tablet, or computer.  Easy Peasy!
